IN THE PENTAGON they must surely be on high alert. On February 9th President Donald Trump declared that it would soon become the target for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Accusing it of “hundreds of billions of fraud and abuse”, Mr Trump will unleash his insurgents, fresh from feeding foreign aid into the woodchipper. Their work could not be more important, or more risky.  
我N 五角大楼 他们肯定处于高度警惕状态。2 月 9 日，唐纳德·特朗普总统宣布，它将很快成为埃隆·马斯克的政府效率部 （DOGE） 的目标。特朗普指责它犯下了“数千亿的欺诈和滥用行为”，他将释放他的叛乱分子，这些叛乱分子刚刚将外国援助送入碎木机。他们的工作再重要不过了，风险也大不过了。

That is because America’s armed forces face a real problem. Not since the Soviet Union launched *Sputnik* and built huge tank formations at the height of the cold war have America’s military vulnerabilities been so glaring. In the killing fields of Ukraine America is being out-innovated by drone designers; in the seas and skies off China it is losing its ability to deter a blockade or invasion of Taiwan.  
这是因为美国武装部队面临着一个真正的问题。自从苏联在冷战最激烈的时候发射了*人造卫星*并建造了巨大的坦克编队以来，美国的军事脆弱性从未如此明显。在乌克兰的杀戮场上，美国被无人机设计师超越了创新;在中国附近的海空，它正在失去威慑对台湾的封锁或入侵的能力。

The stakes are all the higher because the Pentagon is a place where MAGA ideology meets reality. Mr Trump’s foreign policy is transactional: this week he said he had begun talks with Russia on the future of Ukraine. But it is built on the idea that peace comes through strength, and that is possible only if America’s forces pose a credible threat. And what if DOGE goes rogue in the Pentagon? If Mr Musk causes chaos or corrupts procurement, the consequences for America’s security could be catastrophic.  
赌注更高，因为五角大楼是 MAGA 意识形态与现实相遇的地方。特朗普的外交政策是交易性的：本周，他表示已开始与俄罗斯就乌克兰的未来进行谈判。但它建立在这样一种理念之上，即和平来自实力，而这只有在美国军队构成可信的威胁时才有可能。如果 DOGE 在五角大楼流氓怎么办？如果马斯克先生造成混乱或破坏采购，那么对美国安全的后果可能是灾难性的。

The problems are clearest in the struggle to turn [technology into a military advantage](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/02/13/americas-military-supremacy-is-in-jeopardy). The drones over Ukraine are upgraded every few weeks, a pace that is beyond the Pentagon’s budgeting process, which takes years. American and European jammers in electronic warfare cost two or three times as much as Ukrainian ones, but are obsolete. Many big American drones have been useless in Ukraine; newer ones are pricier than Ukrainian models.  
在将[技术转化为军事优势](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/02/13/americas-military-supremacy-is-in-jeopardy)的斗争中，问题最为明显。乌克兰上空的无人机每隔几周就会升级一次，这一速度超出了五角大楼需要数年时间的预算程序。美国和欧洲在电子战中的干扰器成本是乌克兰干扰器的两到三倍，但已经过时了。许多美国大型无人机在乌克兰毫无用处;较新的比乌克兰型号贵。

Another problem is that America’s defence industry has been captured. At the end of the cold war the country had 51 prime contractors and only 6% of defence spending went to firms that specialised in defence. Today, just five primes soak up 86% of the Pentagon’s cash. Wary of driving more primes out of business, the department has opted for a risk-averse culture. Contracts are typically cost-plus, rewarding lateness and overspending. The resulting lack of productivity gains helps explain why building warships in America costs so much more than it does in Japan or South Korea.  
另一个问题是美国的国防工业已经被俘虏了。在冷战结束时，该国有 51 家主要承包商，只有 6% 的国防开支流向了专门从事国防的公司。今天，仅五个首发就吸收了五角大楼 86% 的现金。由于担心将更多 Prime 公司赶出市场，该部门选择了一种规避风险的文化。合同通常是成本加成的，奖励迟到和超支。由此导致的生产力缺乏提高有助于解释为什么在美国建造军舰的成本比在日本或韩国高得多。

Behind this is the nightmare of budgets. Two-year delays are aggravated by congressional squabbling. Pork-barrelling politicians waste money by vetoing the end of programmes. They guard their control over spending so jealously that, without congressional permission, the Pentagon cannot as a rule shift more than $15m from one line to another—too little to buy even four Patriot missiles. When the Pentagon proposed diverting just 0.5% of the defence budget to buy thousands of drones under its “Replicator” initiative in August 2023, winning approval took almost 40 congressional meetings.  
这背后是预算的噩梦。国会的争吵加剧了两年的拖延。胡说八道的政客通过否决计划的结束来浪费金钱。他们如此嫉妒地保护他们对支出的控制，以至于未经国会许可，五角大楼通常不能将超过 $15m 的资金从一条线路转移到另一条线路——太少了，甚至无法购买四枚爱国者导弹。当五角大楼于 2023 年 8 月提议仅将国防预算的 0.5% 用于在其“复制器”计划下购买数千架无人机时，经过近 40 次国会会议后才获得批准。

Pentagon angst is as old as the military-industrial complex. Past secretaries of defence, including Bob Gates and the late Ash Carter, were philosopher kings next to their new and manifestly unqualified successor, Pete Hegseth. And yet the defence bureaucracy has always seemed to come out on top.  
五角大楼的焦虑与军工复合体一样古老。前任国防部长，包括鲍勃·盖茨（Bob Gates）和已故的阿什·卡特（Ash Carter），都是他们明显不合格的新继任者皮特·赫格塞斯（Pete Hegseth）身边的哲学之王。然而，国防官僚机构似乎总是名列前茅。

There are two reasons why this moment may be different. One is that the time is ripe. Not only is the threat to American security becoming clear, but a new generation of mil-tech firms, including Anduril, Palantir and Shield AI, is [banging on the Pentagon’s doors](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/13/defence-tech-is-blowing-up-silicon-valleys-beliefs). Indeed, Palantir is now worth more than any of the five prime contractors.  
这一刻可能会有所不同，有两个原因。一是时机成熟。不仅对美国安全的威胁越来越明显，而且包括 Anduril、Palantir 和 Shield AI 在内的新一代军事技术公司正在敲响五[角大楼的大门](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/13/defence-tech-is-blowing-up-silicon-valleys-beliefs)。事实上，Palantir 现在的价值超过了五家主要承包商中的任何一家。

More controversially, Mr Musk is eager to crack heads together, an enthusiasm which stems partly from the second reason to hope: his experience elsewhere. In the 2010s, to escape the ignominy of paying for rides to the International Space Station on Russian spacecraft, NASA put fixed-price contracts to provide such services out to tender. Boeing offered something called Starliner; Mr Musk’s SpaceX offered Crew Dragon at a much lower cost. Crew Dragon has been a huge success. Starliner has yet to fly a successful mission (and has left Boeing having to absorb billions of dollars of budget overruns).  
更具争议的是，马斯克急于齐心协力，这种热情部分源于希望的第二个原因：他在其他地方的经历。在 2010 年代，为了避免支付乘坐俄罗斯宇宙飞船前往国际空间站的耻辱，NASA 签订了固定价格合同以提供此类服务进行招标。波音公司提供了一种叫做 Starliner 的东西;马斯克的 SpaceX 以低得多的成本向 Crew Dragon 提供。Crew Dragon 取得了巨大的成功。Starliner 尚未成功完成任务（并且使波音不得不吸收数十亿美元的预算超支）。

From 1960 to 2010 the cost of getting a kilogram into orbit hovered at around $12,000; SpaceX rockets have already cut that by a factor of ten, and promise much more. [Helsing](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/13/could-a-german-startup-disrupt-europes-arms-industry), Europe’s only defence unicorn, takes a similarly nimble approach to development, continually updating its systems with data from the front lines.  
从 1960 年到 2010 年，将一公斤送入轨道的成本徘徊在 12,000 美元左右;SpaceX 火箭已经将这一数字降低了 10 倍，并承诺更多。[Helsing](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/13/could-a-german-startup-disrupt-europes-arms-industry) 是欧洲唯一的国防独角兽，它采取了同样灵活的开发方法，不断使用来自前线的数据更新其系统。

Mr Musk’s task is big and complex. American weapons need more AI, autonomy and lower costs. Where possible, they should be made from cheap off-the-shelf parts that ride on advances in consumer tech. The Pentagon should foster competition and risk-taking, knowing that some schemes will fail. A decade ago Carter set up a unit for innovation, but it was often seen as a threat. The Pentagon needs more of them. It should also listen to combatant commanders, too often drowned out by politics. Hardest of all, Mr Trump will have to get congressional Republicans to give the Pentagon a freer rein to spend and innovate.

Reforming the Pentagon is much harder than other parts of government. America cannot focus on preparing for war in 2035 if that involves lowering its defences today. It cannot simply replace multi-billion-dollar submarines and bomber squadrons with swarms of drones, because to project power to the other side of the world will continue to require big platforms. Instead America needs a Department of Defence that can revolutionise the economics of massive systems and accelerate the spread of novel systems at the same time.

Mr Musk and his boss are conflicted. If Mr Trump prefers sacking generals for supposedly being “woke” or disloyal, he will bring dysfunction upon the Pentagon. If Mr Musk and his mil-tech brethren use DOGE’s campaign to wreck, or to boost their own power and wealth, they will corrupt it. Those temptations make it hard to think that this administration will succeed where others have failed. But the hope is that they will. America’s security depends upon it. ■
