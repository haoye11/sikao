Successful stockpickers need a particular set of skills—the ability to parse financial statements, decipher corporate strategies and read the market’s mood. In China they must also interpret Xi Jinping’s state of mind. Five years ago regulators began a sweeping crackdown on tech that drove Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, from public life. It also erased some $2trn in market value, as foreign investors fled Chinese stocks and the country’s private entrepreneurs lost faith in the Communist Party’s commitment to their success.  
成功的选股者需要一套特殊的技能——解析财务报表、解读公司战略和解读市场情绪的能力。在中国，他们还必须解读习近平的心态。五年前，监管机构开始对科技进行全面打击，这让阿里巴巴创始人杰克·马（Jack ）离开了公共生活。它还抹去了大约 20 亿美元的市值，因为外国投资者逃离了中国股票，而该国的私营企业家对共产党对他们成功的承诺失去了信心。

Now the mood is shifting back. On February 17th, when Mr Xi invited a group of tech bosses to a rare “symposium”, Mr Ma was seated in the front row. The high-profile meeting sends a signal that the party wants private enterprise to thrive again—but within limits.  
现在，气氛又回来了。2 月 17 日，当 习 先生邀请一群科技老板参加一场罕见的“座谈会”时，马 先生坐在前排。这场备受瞩目的会议发出了一个信号，即该党希望私营企业再次蓬勃发展——但要受到限制。

The symposium acknowledged that entrepreneurs have much to contribute to China’s economy. At the symposium Mr Xi shook the hand of [DeepSeek](https://www.economist.com/china/2025/02/19/behind-deepseek-lies-a-dazzling-chinese-university)’s founder, Liang Wenfeng. China’s rulers seem as impressed as everyone else by the success of the scrappy startup from Zhejiang province, which has rivalled the world’s best artificial-intelligence (AI) models at a fraction of the cost.  
研讨会承认企业家可以为中国经济做出很大贡献。在座谈会上，习先生与[DeepSeek](https://www.economist.com/china/2025/02/19/behind-deepseek-lies-a-dazzling-chinese-university)创始人梁文峰握手。中国的统治者似乎和其他人一样，对这家来自浙江省的好斗的初创公司的成功印象深刻，它已经与世界上最好的人工智能 （AI） 模型相媲美，而成本只是其中的一小部分。

DeepSeek’s example has injected some liveliness into the stockmarket, lifting the share prices of tech firms listed in Hong Kong by 23% in the past month. The [stocks of Alibaba and Tencent have surged](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/17/why-xi-jinping-is-making-nice-with-chinas-tech-billionaires) in expectation of healthy ai\-related demand.  
DeepSeek 的例子为股市注入了一些活力，在过去一个月里，在香港上市的科技公司的股价上涨了 23%。[阿里巴巴和腾讯的股票飙升](https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/17/why-xi-jinping-is-making-nice-with-chinas-tech-billionaires)，预期人工智能相关需求将保持健康。

The party wants to jump on this bandwagon and keep it rolling. China is still suffering from a long property slump, depressed consumer confidence and a shortfall of spending. It is stuck in its longest spell of deflation since the Asian financial crisis over a quarter of a century ago. A tech-fuelled stockmarket rally could provide some of the stimulus that has so far been lacking: a little greed to temper the anxiety.  
该党希望加入这股潮流并继续前进。中国仍然遭受着长期的房地产低迷、消费者信心低迷和支出不足的困扰。它陷入了自四分之一个多世纪前亚洲金融危机以来最长的通货紧缩时期。科技股推动的股市反弹可能会提供一些迄今为止所缺乏的刺激措施：一点点贪婪来缓和焦虑。

Yet the party may also be warming to private enterprise because it now has less to fear from it. Five years ago, ambitious tech firms were busy amassing vast troves of data on citizens’ spending, borrowing and travel patterns. They knew more about the Chinese people than the party did. At the same time, they were transcending their home country, eagerly courting foreign investors and regulators. Didi, a ride-hailing giant, was so determined to list in New York on schedule in 2021 that it waved aside the misgivings of China’s data regulator.  
然而，该党也可能对私营企业持热情，因为它现在对私营企业的恐惧减少了。五年前，雄心勃勃的科技公司正忙于积累有关公民消费、借贷和出行模式的大量数据。他们比共产党更了解中国人民。与此同时，他们正在超越自己的祖国，热切地吸引外国投资者和监管机构。网约车巨头滴滴决心在 2021 年如期在纽约上市，以至于它抛开了中国数据监管机构的疑虑。

Things are different now. China has tightened rules for overseas listings, bolstered the influence of party committees within private companies and imposed new laws on data collection and transfer. At the same time, America’s hostility to Chinese companies has driven them closer to their home market and government. If foreigners think these firms are “uninvestible”, they must raise money at home. If America denies China access to vital inputs such as high-end computer chips, even private firms will join the party’s mission to achieve self-reliance.  
现在情况不同了。中国收紧了对海外上市的规定，加强了私营公司内部党委的影响力，并实施了有关数据收集和传输的新法律。与此同时，美国对中国公司的敌意使它们更接近本国市场和政府。如果外国人认为这些公司“不可投资”，他们必须在国内筹集资金。如果美国拒绝中国获得高端计算机芯片等重要投入品，那么即使是私营公司也会加入该党实现自力更生的行列。

Mr Xi’s symposium was not an empty gesture. The party is genuinely keen to revive the spirits of entrepreneurs and remove some bureaucratic obstacles to their progress. Yet Mr Xi also cautioned the tech bosses to “remember their roots” as they pursue success.  
习先生的座谈会并非空洞的姿态。该党真正热衷于重振企业家的精神，并消除他们进步的一些官僚主义障碍。然而，习也告诫科技大佬们在追求成功时要“牢记自己的根”。

His vision for the private sector is not serving shareholders but promoting “Chinese-style modernisation”. The party is happy, in other words, to offer support. But what it will not offer is freedom. Its embrace of the private sector is conditional on private capital aligning with the party’s goals. ■  
他对私营部门的愿景不是为股东服务，而是推动“中国式现代化”。换句话说，该党很乐意提供支持。但它不会提供自由。它对私营部门的拥护以私人资本与该党的目标保持一致为条件。■
