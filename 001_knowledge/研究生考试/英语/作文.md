#作文句子/做选择
"You mentioned that you're hesitant to decide whether to attend the art exhibition or the robot show."

**修改依据：**

1. **"are hesitate" 改为 "are hesitant"**：
   - "Hesitate" 是动词，需要用 "hesitant" 这个形容词来描述犹豫的状态。

2. **"make decision on where to visit" 改为 "decide whether to attend"**：
   - 使用 "decide" 和 "whether to attend" 更简洁流畅，避免了“make decision on”的冗长结构。
   
3. **"between" 改为 "whether"**：
   - "Whether" 更符合英语表达决策时的惯用结构，而 "between" 通常用于表示两者间的选择。

1. "You mentioned that you're unsure about choosing between the art exhibition and the robot show." 
2. "You said you were having trouble deciding whether to go to the art exhibition or the robot show."
3. "You mentioned feeling torn between attending the art exhibition and the robot show."
4. "You expressed hesitation in choosing between the art exhibition and the robot show."
5. "You mentioned being undecided on whether to visit the art exhibition or the robot show."
